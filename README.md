# metadata-stripper-chrome

Removes unneeded metadata in HTTP GET requests on common sites such as

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Google
- Imdb
- ...

## Example

When you are searching for someone on facebook in the toolbar, ```?fref=ts``` will be added to the URL.
This does not change anything on the profile that you are viewing and is completely useless for your experience.

```
https://www.facebook.com/user?fref=ts
```

will be changed to

```
https://www.facebook.com/user
```
